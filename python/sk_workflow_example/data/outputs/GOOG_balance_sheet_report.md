To analyze the financial health of Alphabet Inc. (GOOG) based on its balance sheet, we need to calculate the following financial metrics: current ratio, quick ratio, working capital, and debt-to-equity ratio.

I'll compute these metrics for the two most recent periods provided: June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.

### 1. Current Ratio

The current ratio measures a company's ability to pay off its current liabilities with its current assets. It is calculated as:

\[ \text{Current Ratio} = \frac{\text{Total Current Assets}}{\text{Total Current Liabilities}} \]

### June 30, 2024
\[ \text{Current Ratio}_{2024} = \frac{161,995,000,000}{77,913,000,000} = 2.08 \]

### December 31, 2023
\[ \text{Current Ratio}_{2023} = \frac{171,530,000,000}{81,814,000,000} = 2.10 \]

### 2. Quick Ratio

The quick ratio measures a company's ability to meet its short-term obligations with its most liquid assets. It is calculated as:

\[ \text{Quick Ratio} = \frac{\text{Cash and Cash Equivalents} + \text{Marketable Securities} + \text{Accounts Receivable, net}}{\text{Total Current Liabilities}} \]

### June 30, 2024
\[ \text{Quick Ratio}_{2024} = \frac{27,225,000,000 + 73,500,000,000 + 47,087,000,000}{77,913,000,000} = 1.86 \]

### December 31, 2023
\[ \text{Quick Ratio}_{2023} = \frac{24,048,000,000 + 86,868,000,000 + 47,964,000,000}{81,814,000,000} = 1.95 \]

### 3. Working Capital

Working capital indicates the operational efficiency and short-term financial health of a company. It is calculated as:

\[ \text{Working Capital} = \text{Total Current Assets} - \text{Total Current Liabilities} \]

### June 30, 2024
\[ \text{Working Capital}_{2024} = 161,995,000,000 - 77,913,000,000 = 84,082,000,000 \]

### December 31, 2023
\[ \text{Working Capital}_{2023} = 171,530,000,000 - 81,814,000,000 = 89,716,000,000 \]

### 4. Debt-to-Equity Ratio

The debt-to-equity ratio measures a company's financial leverage. It is calculated as:

\[ \text{Debt-to-Equity Ratio} = \frac{\text{Total Liabilities}}{\text{Stockholders' Equity}} \]

### June 30, 2024
\[ \text{Debt-to-Equity Ratio}_{2024} = \frac{114,017,000,000}{300,753,000,000} = 0.38 \]

### December 31, 2023
\[ \text{Debt-to-Equity Ratio}_{2023} = \frac{119,013,000,000}{283,379,000,000} = 0.42 \]

### Interpretation

1. **Current Ratio**: Both periods show a current ratio above 2, indicating that GOOG is in a good position to cover its short-term liabilities with its short-term assets. A ratio above 1 is generally considered good, with ratios around 2 or above suggesting financial stability.

2. **Quick Ratio**: For both periods, the quick ratio is comfortably above 1, meaning that GOOG can meet its short-term obligations without relying on the sale of inventories. This is indicative of strong liquidity.

3. **Working Capital**: The positive working capital in both periods indicates the company has sufficient short-term assets to cover its short-term liabilities. The working capital has decreased slightly from December 2023 to June 2024.

4. **Debt-to-Equity Ratio**: A debt-to-equity ratio below 1 (0.38 and 0.42 for the two periods) suggests that GOOG is not heavily reliant on debt financing and has been funding its operations through equity rather than taking large amounts of debt. This indicates lower financial risk and greater solvency.

Overall, based on these metrics, Alphabet Inc. (GOOG) appears to be in good financial health, with strong liquidity, positive working capital, and low reliance on debt.
