### Financial Ratios and Analysis

#### 1. **Current Ratio**
The current ratio measures a company's ability to pay short-term obligations with its current assets.

\[ \text{Current Ratio} = \frac{\text{Total Current Assets}}{\text{Total Current Liabilities}} \]

- **March 31, 2024:**
\[ \text{Current Ratio} = \frac{147.18 \text{ billion}}{118.525 \text{ billion}} \approx 1.24 \]

- **June 30, 2023:**
\[ \text{Current Ratio} = \frac{184.257 \text{ billion}}{104.149 \text{ billion}} \approx 1.77 \]

**Interpretation:** A current ratio above 1 indicates that Microsoft has enough current assets to cover its current liabilities. A decrease from 1.77 to 1.24 in this ratio suggests that while the company remains solvent, its liquidity has reduced during the period.

#### 2. **Quick Ratio**
The quick ratio measures a company's ability to meet its short-term obligations with its most liquid assets.

\[ \text{Quick Ratio} = \frac{\text{Total Current Assets} - \text{Inventories}}{\text{Total Current Liabilities}} \]

- **March 31, 2024:**
\[ \text{Quick Ratio} = \frac{147.18 \text{ billion} - 1.304 \text{ billion}}{118.525 \text{ billion}} \approx 1.23 \]

- **June 30, 2023:**
\[ \text{Quick Ratio} = \frac{184.257 \text{ billion} - 2.5 \text{ billion}}{104.149 \text{ billion}} \approx 1.74 \]

**Interpretation:** A quick ratio above 1 suggests that Microsoft can cover its short-term obligations without relying on the sale of inventory. The decline from 1.74 to 1.23 mirrors the trend seen in the current ratio, indicating a reduction in liquidity.

#### 3. **Working Capital**
Working capital measures a company's operational efficiency and short-term financial health.

\[ \text{Working Capital} = \text{Total Current Assets} - \text{Total Current Liabilities} \]

- **March 31, 2024:**
\[ \text{Working Capital} = 147.18 \text{ billion} - 118.525 \text{ billion} = 28.655 \text{ billion} \]

- **June 30, 2023:**
\[ \text{Working Capital} = 184.257 \text{ billion} - 104.149 \text{ billion} = 80.108 \text{ billion} \]

**Interpretation:** Positive working capital indicates that Microsoft can fund its current operations and invest in future activities. However, the significant decrease from $80.108 billion to $28.655 billion shows a reduction in short-term financial health and operating efficiency over the period.

#### 4. **Debt-to-Equity Ratio**
The debt-to-equity ratio compares a company's total liabilities to its stockholders' equity.

\[ \text{Debt-to-Equity Ratio} = \frac{\text{Total Liabilities}}{\text{Total Stockholders' Equity}} \]

- **March 31, 2024:**
\[ \text{Debt-to-Equity Ratio} = \frac{231.123 \text{ billion}}{253.152 \text{ billion}} \approx 0.91 \]

- **June 30, 2023:**
\[ \text{Debt-to-Equity Ratio} = \frac{205.753 \text{ billion}}{206.223 \text{ billion}} \approx 1.00 \]

**Interpretation:** A debt-to-equity ratio less than 1 suggests that Microsoft has more equity than debt, which is generally seen as positive financial health. The reduction from 1.00 to 0.91 indicates an improved leverage position, meaning the company has decreased its relative debt burden over equity.

### Conclusion
Microsoft remains in a strong financial position based on the ratios calculated. Despite a noticeable decline in liquidity metrics such as the current and quick ratios, the company still exhibits the ability to cover its short-term liabilities. The working capital reduction warrants attention but remains positive. Finally, the improved debt-to-equity ratio suggests a stronger equity position relative to its liabilities.
