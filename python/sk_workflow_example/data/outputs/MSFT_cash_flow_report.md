To analyze the financial health of Microsoft (MSFT) from the perspective of its cash flow statement, I will calculate the requested metrics for the provided dates. 

### Data Overview:
#### Cash Flow Statement (March 31, 2024 and March 31, 2023):

**March 31, 2024:**
- Net cash from operations: $31,917,000,000
- Net cash used in financing: -$18,808,000,000
- Net cash used in investing: -$10,700,000,000
- Net change in cash and cash equivalents: $2,329,000,000
- Cash and cash equivalents, end of period: $19,634,000,000

**March 31, 2023:**
- Net cash from operations: $24,441,000,000
- Net cash used in financing: -$10,290,000,000
- Net cash used in investing: -$3,264,000,000
- Net change in cash and cash equivalents: $10,916,000,000
- Cash and cash equivalents, end of period: $26,562,000,000

#### Balance Sheet:

**March 31, 2024:**
- Total liabilities: $231,123,000,000
- Common stock and paid-in capital: 7,433 (Shares Outstanding)

**June 30, 2023:**
- Total liabilities: $205,753,000,000
- Common stock and paid-in capital: 7,433 (Shares Outstanding)

### Calculations:
1. **Cash Flow Per Share (CFPS):**
\[ \text{CFPS} = \frac{\text{Net Cash from Operations}}{\text{Shares Outstanding}} \]

2. **Free Cash Flow (FCF):**
\[ \text{FCF} = \text{Net Cash from Operations} - \text{Capital Expenditures (Additions to property and equipment)} \]

3. **Cash Flow to Debt Ratio (CFD):**
\[ \text{CFD} = \frac{\text{Net Cash from Operations}}{\text{Total Liabilities}} \]

#### March 31, 2024:
- **CFPS:** 
\[ \text{CFPS} = \frac{31,917,000,000}{7,433,000} = \$4.29 \]

- **FCF:**
\[ \text{FCF} = 31,917,000,000 - 10,952,000,000 = \$20,965,000,000 \]

- **CFD:**
\[ \text{CFD} = \frac{31,917,000,000}{231,123,000,000} = 0.138 \]

#### March 31, 2023:
- **CFPS:** 
\[ \text{CFPS} = \frac{24,441,000,000}{7,433,000} = \$3.29 \]

- **FCF:**
\[ \text{FCF} = 24,441,000,000 - 6,607,000,000 = \$17,834,000,000 \]

- **CFD:**
\[ \text{CFD} = \frac{24,441,000,000}{205,753,000,000} = 0.119 \]

### Interpretation of Results:
- **Cash Flow Per Share (CFPS):** An increase in CFPS from $3.29 to $4.29 suggests that Microsoft has improved its ability to generate cash per share, indicating stronger operational performance.
  
- **Free Cash Flow (FCF):** FCF has grown from $17.834 billion to $20.965 billion, reflecting greater efficiency in generating cash after capital expenditures. This can indicate a healthier financial position and potential for increased shareholder returns.
  
- **Cash Flow to Debt Ratio (CFD):** An improvement in CFD from 0.119 to 0.138 shows that Microsoft has a stronger capability to cover its liabilities with cash generated from operations, indicating improved financial stability.

Overall, these metrics suggest that Microsoft's financial health has strengthened over the reviewed periods. The company has shown improved operational efficiency, increased capability to generate free cash, and better coverage of its debt with operational cash flow.
