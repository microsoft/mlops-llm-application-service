### Calculations

1. **Gross Margin**:
\[ \text{Gross Margin} = \frac{\text{Revenues} - \text{Cost of Revenues}}{\text{Revenues}} \times 100 \]

2. **Operating Margin**:
\[ \text{Operating Margin} = \frac{\text{Income from Operations}}{\text{Revenues}} \times 100 \]

3. **Profit Margin**:
\[ \text{Profit Margin} = \frac{\text{Net Income}}{\text{Revenues}} \times 100 \]

4. **Earnings Per Share (EPS)**
(Numbers already provided as Basic and Diluted EPS)

5. **Price-to-Earnings Ratio (P/E)**
\[ \text{P/E Ratio} = \frac{\text{Stock Price}}{\text{Diluted EPS}} \]

6. **Return on Equity (ROE)**
\[ \text{ROE} = \frac{\text{Net Income}}{\text{Total Stockholders' Equity}} \times 100 \]


### Calculated Metrics

#### For period ending Jun 30, 2024:
- **Gross Margin**:
\[ \text{Gross Margin} = \frac{84,742,000,000 - 35,507,000,000}{84,742,000,000} \times 100 = 58.1\% \]

- **Operating Margin**:
\[ \text{Operating Margin} = \frac{27,425,000,000}{84,742,000,000} \times 100 = 32.4\% \]

- **Profit Margin**:
\[ \text{Profit Margin} = \frac{23,619,000,000}{84,742,000,000} \times 100 = 27.9\% \]

- **EPS**: 
  - Basic EPS: $1.91
  - Diluted EPS: $1.89

- **P/E Ratio**:
\[ \text{P/E Ratio} = \frac{165.8}{1.89} = 87.7 \]

- **ROE**:
\[ \text{ROE} = \frac{23,619,000,000}{300,753,000,000} \times 100 = 7.85\% \]

#### For period ending Jun 30, 2023:
- **Gross Margin**:
\[ \text{Gross Margin} = \frac{74,604,000,000 - 31,916,000,000}{74,604,000,000} \times 100 = 57.2\% \]

- **Operating Margin**:
\[ \text{Operating Margin} = \frac{21,838,000,000}{74,604,000,000} \times 100 = 29.3\% \]

- **Profit Margin**:
\[ \text{Profit Margin} = \frac{18,368,000,000}{74,604,000,000} \times 100 = 24.6\% \]

- **EPS**:
  - Basic EPS: $1.45
  - Diluted EPS: $1.44

- **P/E Ratio** (using stock price and diluted EPS for uniformity):
\[ \text{P/E Ratio} = \frac{165.8}{1.44} = 115.1 \]

- **ROE**:
\[ \text{ROE} = \frac{18,368,000,000}{283,379,000,000} \times 100 = 6.48\% \]

### Interpretation

1. **Gross Margin**: Google's gross margins are strong at 58.1% for 2024 and 57.2% for 2023, indicating efficient production and service delivery with substantial leftovers over the cost of revenues.
 
2. **Operating Margin**: The operating margins are 32.4% for 2024 and 29.3% for 2023, which is quite healthy and shows good control over operating expenses relative to revenues.

3. **Profit Margin**: The profit margins are 27.9% for 2024 and 24.6% for 2023, reflecting strong profitability after all expenses and taxes.

4. **EPS**:  Basic and Diluted EPS have shown growth from 2023 to 2024, illustrating improved earnings per share over the period.

5. **P/E Ratio**: The high P/E ratios (87.7 for 2024 and 115.1 for 2023) suggest that the stock may be overvalued, or investors have high expectations for future growth.

6. **ROE**: The ROE is 7.85% for 2024 and 6.48% for 2023, showing an improving return on shareholders' equity.

Overall, Google presents as a financially strong company with healthy margins and profitability, though the high P/E ratios necessitate deeper consideration of market expectations versus valuation.
