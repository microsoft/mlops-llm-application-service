Based on the provided balance sheet data for Intel Corporation (INTC) on two dates, here are the metrics for assessing the financial health:

### Metrics

**1. Current Ratio:**
The current ratio measures a company's ability to pay short-term liabilities with its short-term assets.

\[
\text{Current Ratio} = \frac{\text{Total Current Assets}}{\text{Total Current Liabilities}}
\]

**2. Quick Ratio:**
The quick ratio, or acid-test ratio, measures the ability to meet short-term obligations using the most liquid assets.

\[
\text{Quick Ratio} = \frac{\text{Cash and Cash Equivalents + Short-term Investments + Accounts Receivable}}{\text{Total Current Liabilities}}
\]

**3. Working Capital:**
Working capital measures the company's operational efficiency and short-term financial health.

\[
\text{Working Capital} = \text{Total Current Assets} - \text{Total Current Liabilities}
\]

**4. Debt-to-Equity Ratio:**
The debt-to-equity ratio measures the proportion of shareholder's equity and debt used to finance a company's assets.

\[
\text{Debt-to-Equity Ratio} = \frac{\text{Total Debt}}{\text{Total Stockholders' Equity}}
\]

### Calculations

Let's compute these metrics for the two provided periods:

#### For Jun 29, 2024:

**Total Current Assets:** \$50,829,000,000  
**Total Current Liabilities:** \$32,027,000,000  
**Cash and Cash Equivalents:** \$11,287,000,000  
**Short-term Investments:** \$17,986,000,000  
**Accounts Receivable:** \$3,131,000,000  
**Total Debt:** \$46,950,000 + \$48,334,000,000  
**Total Stockholders' Equity:** \$115,229,000,000

**Current Ratio:**
\[
\frac{50,829,000,000}{32,027,000,000} = 1.59
\]

**Quick Ratio:**
\[
\frac{11,287,000,000 + 17,986,000,000 + 3,131,000,000}{32,027,000,000} = \frac{32,404,000,000}{32,027,000,000} = 1.01
\]

**Working Capital:**
\[
50,829,000,000 - 32,027,000,000 = 18,802,000,000
\]

**Debt-to-Equity Ratio:**
\[
\frac{469,500,000 + 48,334,000,000}{115,229,000,000} = \frac{48,803,500,000}{115,229,000,000} = 0.42
\]

#### For Dec 30, 2023:

**Total Current Assets:** \$43,269,000,000  
**Total Current Liabilities:** \$28,053,000,000  
**Cash and Cash Equivalents:** \$7,079,000,000  
**Short-term Investments:** \$17,955,000,000  
**Accounts Receivable:** \$3,402,000,000  
**Total Debt:** \$2,288,000,000 + \$46,978,000,000  
**Total Stockholders' Equity:** \$105,590,000,000

**Current Ratio:**
\[
\frac{43,269,000,000}{28,053,000,000} = 1.54
\]

**Quick Ratio:**
\[
\frac{7,079,000,000 + 17,955,000,000 + 3,402,000,000}{28,053,000,000} = \frac{28,436,000,000}{28,053,000,000} = 1.01
\]

**Working Capital:**
\[
43,269,000,000 - 28,053,000,000 = 15,216,000,000
\]

**Debt-to-Equity Ratio:**
\[
\frac{2,288,000,000 + 46,978,000,000}{105,590,000,000} = \frac{49,266,000,000}{105,590,000,000} = 0.47
\]

### Interpretation

1. **Current Ratio**: Both periods have a current ratio greater than 1, indicating that Intel has enough current assets to cover current liabilities. The company is in a relatively good short-term liquidity position.

2. **Quick Ratio**: The quick ratio is about 1.01 for both periods, suggesting that Intel can meet its short-term obligations with its most liquid assets without having to rely heavily on the sale of its inventory.

3. **Working Capital**: Intel's working capital is positive for both periods, with a slight increase in the most recent period. This indicates that Intel has sufficient short-term assets to cover its short-term liabilities, which is a good sign of operational efficiency.

4. **Debt-to-Equity Ratio**: The debt-to-equity ratio is below 1 for both periods, suggesting that Intel is not overly reliant on debt to finance its assets. The ratio is slightly lower in the recent period, indicating a more debt-financed approach, but still manageable.

Overall, Intel seems to be in good financial health based on these metrics. The current and quick ratios suggest adequate liquidity, and a positive working capital indicates operational efficiency. The debt-to-equity ratio shows a balanced approach to using debt and equity to finance assets.
