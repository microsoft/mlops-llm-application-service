### Financial Metrics Calculation:

1. **Gross Margin:**
   \[ \text{Gross Margin} = \frac{\text{Gross Profit}}{\text{Net Revenue}} \]

2. **Operating Margin:**
   \[ \text{Operating Margin} = \frac{\text{Operating Income}}{\text{Net Revenue}} \]

3. **Profit Margin:**
   \[ \text{Profit Margin} = \frac{\text{Net Income}}{\text{Net Revenue}} \]

4. **Earnings Per Share (EPS):**
   \[ \text{EPS} = \frac{\text{Net Income Attributable to Intel}}{\text{Shares Outstanding}} \]

5. **Price-to-Earnings (P/E) Ratio:**
   \[ \text{P/E Ratio} = \frac{\text{Stock Price}}{\text{EPS}} \]

6. **Return on Equity (ROE):**
   \[ \text{ROE} = \frac{\text{Net Income Attributable to Intel}}{\text{Total Stockholders' Equity}} \]

#### Calculation Results:

**For the period ending June 29, 2024:**

1. **Gross Margin:**
   \[ \text{Gross Margin} = \frac{\$4,547,000,000}{\$12,833,000,000} \approx 35.43\% \]

2. **Operating Margin:**
   \[ \text{Operating Margin} = \frac{\text{Operating Income}}{\text{Net Revenue}} = \frac{-\$1,964,000,000}{\$12,833,000,000} \approx -15.30\% \]

3. **Profit Margin:**
   \[ \text{Profit Margin} = \frac{\text{Net Income}}{\text{Net Revenue}} = \frac{-\$1,654,000,000}{\$12,833,000,000} \approx -12.89\% \]

4. **Earnings Per Share:**
   \[ \text{EPS} = -\$0.38 \]

5. **Price-to-Earnings (P/E) Ratio (N/A due to negative EPS)**:
   \[ \text{P/E Ratio} = \frac{\$22.40}{\text{N/A}} = \text{N/A} \] 

6. **Return on Equity:**
   \[ \text{ROE} = \frac{\text{Net Income Attributable to Intel}}{\text{Total Stockholders' Equity}} = \frac{-\$1,610,000,000}{\$115,229,000,000} \approx -1.40\% \]

**For the period ending July 1, 2023:**

1. **Gross Margin:**
   \[ \text{Gross Margin} = \frac{\$4,638,000,000}{\$12,949,000,000} \approx 35.82\% \]

2. **Operating Margin:**
   \[ \text{Operating Margin} = \frac{\text{Operating Income}}{\text{Net Revenue}} = \frac{-\$1,016,000,000}{\$12,949,000,000} \approx -7.84\% \]

3. **Profit Margin:**
   \[ \text{Profit Margin} = \frac{\text{Net Income}}{\text{Net Revenue}} = \frac{\$1,473,000,000}{\$12,949,000,000} \approx 11.37\% \]

4. **Earnings Per Share:**
   \[ \text{EPS} = \$0.35 \]

5. **Price-to-Earnings (P/E) Ratio**:
   \[ \text{P/E Ratio} = \frac{\$22.40}{\$0.35} \approx 64.00 \]

6. **Return on Equity:**
   \[ \text{ROE} = \frac{\text{Net Income Attributable to Intel}}{\text{Total Stockholders' Equity}} = \frac{\$1,481,000,000}{\$105,590,000,000} \approx 1.40\% \]

### Interpretation:

- Intel's gross margin remains stable around 35%, indicating the company maintains consistent gross profitability relative to its sales.
- The operating margin is negative for both periods, indicating operational inefficiency or high operating costs.
- The profit margin shows a negative trend in the most recent period (Jun 29, 2024), a significant decrease, indicating less efficiency in converting sales into actual profit.
- The EPS turned from positive $0.35 in July 2023 to a negative $0.38 in June 2024, showcasing a decline in profitability per share.
- The P/E ratio is high at 64.00 for the earlier period, indicating that investors had high expectations for future earnings; however, the ratio is N/A for the latest period due to negative EPS, reflecting recent financial struggles.
- The ROE indicates a return of -1.40% for the latest period compared to 1.40% for the earlier period, suggesting a sharp decline in the efficiency of equity utilization to generate profit.

In summary, Intel's most recent financial performance shows considerable challenges, with negative profitability margins and losses, whereas the previous period indicates better performance but still operating inefficiency.
