### Metrics Calculations:

1. **Cash Flow per Share**
   \[
   \text{Cash Flow per Share} = \frac{\text{Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities}}{\text{Number of Outstanding Shares}}
   \]
   - For June 29, 2024:
     \[
     \text{Cash Flow per Share} = \frac{1,069,000,000}{4,276,000,000} = \$0.25
     \]
   - For July 1, 2023:
     \[
     \text{Cash Flow per Share} = \frac{1,023,000,000}{4,228,000,000} \approx \$0.24
     \]

2. **Free Cash Flow**
   \[
   \text{Free Cash Flow} = \text{Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities} - \text{Additions to Property, Plant, and Equipment}
   \]
   - For June 29, 2024:
     \[
     \text{Free Cash Flow} = 1,069,000,000 - 11,652,000,000 = -\$10,583,000,000
     \]
   - For July 1, 2023:
     \[
     \text{Free Cash Flow} = 1,023,000,000 - 13,301,000,000 = -\$12,278,000,000
     \]

3. **Cash Flow to Debt Ratio**
   \[
   \text{Cash Flow to Debt Ratio} = \frac{\text{Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities}}{\text{Total Debt}}
   \]
   - For June 29, 2024:
     \[
     \text{Cash Flow to Debt Ratio} = \frac{1,069,000,000}{48,334,000,000} \approx 0.022
     \]
   - For July 1, 2023:
     \[
     \text{Cash Flow to Debt Ratio} = \frac{1,023,000,000}{46,978,000,000} \approx 0.022
     \]

### Interpretation:

1. **Cash Flow per Share**:
   - Intel's cash flow per share slightly improved from $0.24 to $0.25. This incremental growth indicates that the company is generating modestly better cash flow per share over time.

2. **Free Cash Flow**:
   - Both periods show a significant negative free cash flow. This indicates that Intel is heavily investing in property, plant, and equipment, which could be for expansion or modernization of its facilities. However, negative free cash flow can also strain the company's liquidity if it persists over longer periods.

3. **Cash Flow to Debt Ratio**:
   - The cash flow to debt ratio remains very low at 0.022 for both periods. This low ratio suggests that Intel's operating cash flow is quite small compared to its total debt. High debt levels combined with relatively low operational cash flow can raise concerns about the company's ability to cover its debt obligations without external financing or asset sales.

Overall, while Intel is managing to generate operating cash flow, its significant investments in property and equipment are leading to negative free cash flow and a low cash flow to debt ratio, which may indicate potential risk areas that warrant further monitoring.
