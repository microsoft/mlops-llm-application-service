To analyze Google's (GOOG) financial health using the cash flow and balance sheet statements, I'll calculate the following key metrics: cash flow per share, free cash flow, and cash flow to debt ratio. Let's go through the computations step-by-step for the periods provided (June 30, 2024, and June 30, 2023).

### 1. Cash Flow Per Share (CFPS)

Formula:
\[ \text{Cash Flow Per Share} = \frac{\text{Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities}}{\text{Number of Shares Outstanding}} \]

### 2. Free Cash Flow (FCF)

Formula:
\[ \text{Free Cash Flow} = \text{Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities} - \text{Capital Expenditures} \]

Capital expenditures can be found under "Purchases of property and equipment."

### 3. Cash Flow to Debt Ratio

Formula:
\[ \text{Cash Flow to Debt Ratio} = \frac{\text{Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities}}{\text{Total Debt}} \]

Total debt is the sum of "Current portion of Debt" and "Long-term debt" from the balance sheet.

The number of shares outstanding can be approximated from the balance sheet under the reported shares issued and outstanding.

### Data Extraction and Calculation
#### For the period ending June 30, 2024:
- **Net Cash Provided By Operating Activities**: $55,488 million
- **Capital Expenditures (Purchases of property and equipment)**: $25,198 million
- **Long-term debt**: $13,238 million
- **Shares Outstanding**: 12,460 million shares (approx.)

##### Calculations
**Cash Flow Per Share:**
\[ \text{CFPS} = \frac{55,488 }{12,460} = 4.45 \text{ USD} \]

**Free Cash Flow:**
\[ \text{FCF} = 55,488 - 25,198 = 30,290 \text{ million USD} \]

**Cash Flow to Debt Ratio:**
\[ \text{Cash Flow to Debt Ratio} = \frac{55,488}{13,238} = 4.19 \]

#### For the period ending June 30, 2023:
- **Net Cash Provided By Operating Activities**: $52,175 million
- **Capital Expenditures (Purchases of property and equipment)**: $13,177 million
- **Long-term debt**: $13,253 million (Dec 31, 2023)
- **Shares Outstanding**: 12,322 million shares (approx.)

##### Calculations
**Cash Flow Per Share:**
\[ \text{CFPS} = \frac{52,175}{12,322} = 4.23 \text{ USD} \]

**Free Cash Flow:**
\[ \text{FCF} = 52,175 - 13,177 = 38,998 \text{ million USD} \]

**Cash Flow to Debt Ratio:**
\[ \text{Cash Flow to Debt Ratio} = \frac{52,175}{13,253} = 3.94 \]

### Interpretation

1. **Cash Flow Per Share**:
   - For the period ending June 30, 2024: $4.45
   - For the period ending June 30, 2023: $4.23
   
   The CFPS shows that Google's cash flow per share has increased, indicating improved efficiency in generating cash from operations on a per-share basis.

2. **Free Cash Flow**:
   - For the period ending June 30, 2024: $30,290 million
   - For the period ending June 30, 2023: $38,998 million
   
   While Google's operating activities have continued to generate substantial cash, their free cash flow has decreased due to increased capital expenditures in 2024. Despite the decrease, a robust FCF signifies that Google still has a significant amount of cash left after ensuring necessary capital expenditures.

3. **Cash Flow to Debt Ratio**:
   - For the period ending June 30, 2024: 4.19
   - For the period ending June 30, 2023: 3.94
   
   The increase in the cash flow to debt ratio implies that Google has improved its ability to cover its total debt with the cash flow generated from its operations, suggesting financial strength and a lower risk of insolvency.

These metrics cumulatively indicate that Google is financially healthy, with strong operational efficiency and the ability to meet its obligations and reinvest in growth efficiently.
