Operating Margin\n\nFormula:\n\\[ \\text{Operating Margin} = \\frac{\\text{Operating Income}}{\\text{Revenue}} \\]\n\n**Sep 30, 2024:**\n- Operating Income = $30,552,000,000\n\n\\[ \\text{Operating Margin} = \\frac{30552000000}{65585000000} \\approx 46.56\\% \\]\n\n**Sep 30, 2023:**\n- Operating Income = $26,895,000,000\n\n\\[ \\text{Operating Margin} = \\frac{26895000000}{56517000000} \\approx 47.58\\% \\]\n\n### 4. Basic Earnings Per Share (EPS)\n\nFormula:\n\\[ \\text{Basic EPS} = \\frac{\\text{Net Income}}{\\text{Basic Weighted Average Shares}} \\]\n\n**Sep 30, 2024:**\n- Basic Weighted Average Shares = 7,433,000,000\n\n\\[ \\text{Basic EPS} = \\frac{24667000000}{7433000000} \\approx 3.32 \\]\n\n**Sep 30, 2023:**\n- Basic Weighted Average Shares = 7,429,000,000\n\n\\[ \\text{Basic EPS} = \\frac{22291000000}{7429000000} \\approx 3.00 \\]\n\n### 5. Basic Price to Earnings Ratio (P/E)\n\nFormula:\n\\[ \\text{P/E Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Stock Price}}{\\text{Basic EPS}} \\]\n\n**Sep 30, 2024:**\n- Stock Price = $429.44\n\n\\[ \\text{P/E Ratio} = \\frac{429.44}{3.32} \\approx 129.32 \\]\n\n**Sep 30, 2023:**\n- Stock Price = $318.76\n\n\\[ \\text{P/E Ratio} = \\frac{318.76}{3.00} \\approx 106.25 \\]\n\n### 6. Return on Equity (ROE)\n\nFormula:\n\\[ \\text{ROE} = \\frac{\\text{Net Income}}{\\text{Total Shareholder's Equity}} \\]\n\n**Sep 30, 2024:**\n- Total Shareholder's Equity = $287,723,000,000\n\n\\[ \\text{ROE} = \\frac{24667000000}{287723000000} \\approx 8.57\\% \\]\n\n**Sep 30, 2023:**\n- Total Shareholder's Equity = $268,477,000,000\n\n\\[ \\text{ROE} = \\frac{22291000000}{268477000000} \\approx 8.30\\% \\]\n\n### Interpretation\n\n**Gross Margin:** The gross margin has decreased from 71.17% in 2023 to 69.34% in 2024, indicating a slight increase in the cost of goods sold relative to revenue.\n\n**Profit Margin:** The profit margin also shows a small decline from 39.45% to 37.61%, suggesting a decrease in net income efficiency concerning revenue.\n\n**Operating Margin:** There's a slight decrease from 47.58% to 46.56%, which indicates a consistent operational efficiency but with a minor impact from potential increased operational costs or possibly lower revenue growth.\n\n**EPS and P/E Ratio:** The EPS has increased indicating higher earnings per share, but the significant jump in the P/E ratio reflects higher future growth expectations or possibly stock price inflation over fundamental earnings growth.\n\n**ROE:** The stable ROE suggests that the company's ability to generate profit from shareholders' equity remains robust, albeit slightly improved.\n\nOverall, Microsoft maintains a strong financial health with a high operational and profit generation capability, though there are slight efficiency declines which coincide with stock price inflation as observed from the P/E ratios.To analyze the financial health of Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) using the cash flow and balance sheet statements for the periods ending September 30, 2024, and September 30, 2023, we will calculate the following financial metrics: cash flow per share, free cash flow, and cash flow to debt ratio.\n\n### 1. Cash Flow Per Share\n\n- **Formula:** Cash Flow from Operations / Total Shares Outstanding\n\n**For September 30, 2024:**\n- Net Cash from Operations: $34,180,000,000\n- Total Shares Outstanding: 7,436 million\n\n\\[ \\text{Cash Flow Per Share} = \\frac{34,180,000,000}{7,436,000,000} \\approx \\$4.60 \\]\n\n**For September 30, 2023:**\n- Net Cash from Operations: $30,583,000,000\n- Total Shares Outstanding: 7,434 million\n\n\\[ \\text{Cash Flow Per Share} = \\frac{30,583,000,000}{7,434,000,000} \\approx \\$4.11 \\]\n\n### 2. Free Cash Flow\n\n- **Formula:** Net Cash from Operations - Capital Expenditures\n\n**For September 30, 2024:**\n- Net Cash from Operations: $34,180,000,000\n- Capital Expenditures: $14,923,000,000\n\n\\[ \\text{Free Cash Flow} = 34,180,000,000 - 14,923,000,000 = 19,257,000,000 \\]\n\n**For September 30, 2023:**\n- Net Cash from Operations: $30,583,000,000\n- Capital Expenditures: $9,917,000,000\n\n\\[ \\text{Free Cash Flow} = 30,583,000,000 - 9,917,000,000 = 20,666,000,000 \\]\n\n### 3. Cash Flow to Debt Ratio\n\n- **Formula:** Net Cash from Operations / Total Debt\n\n**For September 30, 2024:**\n- Net Cash from Operations: $34,180,000,000\n- Total Debt (Short-term debt + Long-term debt): $0 + $42,868,000,000 = $42,868,000,000\n\n\\[ \\text{Cash Flow to Debt Ratio} = \\frac{34,180,000,000}{42,868,000,000} \\approx 0.80 \\]\n\n**For September 30, 2023:**\n- Net Cash from Operations: $30,583,000,000\n- Total Debt (Short-term debt + Long-term debt): $0 + $42,688,000,000 = $42,688,000,000\n\n\\[ \\text{Cash Flow to Debt Ratio} = \\frac{30,583,000,000}{42,688,000,000} \\approx 0.72 \\]\n\n### Interpretation\n\n- **Cash Flow Per Share:** Indicates how much cash a company is generating per share. Microsoft's cash flow per share increased from $4.11 in 2023 to $4.60 in 2024, showing an improvement in its cash flow generation per share.\n  \n- **Free Cash Flow:** This metric provides insight into the cash a company can generate after reinvestments in its business. While free cash flow decreased from $20,666 million in 2023 to $19,257 million in 2024, it remains robust, indicating strong cash generation capabilities.\n\n- **Cash Flow to Debt Ratio:** A higher ratio indicates better ability to cover debt with cash from operations. Microsoft improved its ratio from 0.72 to 0.80, indicating stronger coverage of its debt obligations by its operational cash flows.\n\nOverall, Microsoft displays strong financial health with robust cash flow generation and a solid ability to manage and cover its debt obligations."}
